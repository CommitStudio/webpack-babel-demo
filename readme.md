### Open the project in your machine

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

On the `webpack.config.js` file you can find the examples covered on the Blog post.
To see the project working run `npm run build` on your terminal to see the code compiled and optimized for production!

Feel free to make any changes you want and run the build again to see the new bundle/s!
